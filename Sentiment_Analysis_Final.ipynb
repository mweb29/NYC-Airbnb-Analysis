First time in New York before booking I exchanged with this one in order to avoid any inconvenience during my stay.  Communication was good.But the problem arose when I arrived.  After a flight of more than 7:30 a.m. I just wanted to sleep, to rest well the first morning so that I could enjoy the rest of my stay and be in good shape.I received the day before a message from Daniel telling me that he would not be at the loft when I arrived and that we would see each other in the morning,I told him that I had a long trip and that I intended to rest this first morning and that we would see each other when I woke up.I arrived quite late in the evening I had warned him there is no problem for late arrivals knowing. At 8 am Daniel arrived at the apartment with his dogs, and did not respect the fact that I was sleeping and made a lot of noise, coffee machine, blender etc... (kitchen facing  the door \\u00ab\\u00a0partition room\\u00a0\\u00bb he received the call from his girlfriend who had a car problem, he put her on speakerphone!!!And spoke with her for several minutes.  The real bedroom is a partition, it's not a wall, it's planks, a rapid construction of what he calls a bedroom. No isolation and no privacy you can hear everything.So I couldn't rest (4 hours of sleep) so I got up.Ithought to myself he looks cool I'm not here to have any problems let it pass.  We got to know each other a little, the communication went well.  After spending the day outside I come home tired I go to bed but impossible to sleep because the upstairs neighbor was making a lot of noise from 1 a.m. until 3:30 a.m., you can hear when he sings when he whistles, when he walks when he goes to the toilet in short we live with the neighbour.  I send a message to Daniel asking him if the upstairs neighbor is aware that there is someone currently in his loft (because Daniel has another apartment where he lives there with his girlfriend next to this one) specifying  that if I can't sleep in the morning and also in the evening it's going to be complicated.  I saw him in the morning, we don't discuss it, he tells me that it's New York, that's how the person upstairs used to live from his loft, etc.  OK !  I don't want to epilogue let's move on.  2nd day I spend my day outside it snowed in it is very cold so happy to come back to be able to take a hot shower, and there Surprise !!!  the hot water only ran for two minutes, I waited for it to come back of course still no hot water I turned off the water, I still turned on no hot water!!!  The water was freezing, I had to rinse with.I send a message to this one unfortunately it was a little late around 11 p.m. but I had no choice.  He answers me by telling me that he had no problem with the water.I dont think that Is it normal when it's over -5 degrees outside to take a cold shower ! So Too much for me,  I send a message to Airbnb because for me it was too much trouble.I could have overlooked a lot of things but not this.  Airbnb decides to inform him and there I discovered another personality of Daniel, he knocked very hard on the door spoke to me in an aggressive tone, and told me that I had one hour to leave the apartment (rather his place of work  ), I did not intend to leave an opinion but following his change of personality I thought that people might need this feedback to know that: Daniel is a person who will be cool with you, which is completely normal, it is thanks to us that he can pay his 2nd rent!  and yes it's not an artists loft it's his place of work he's not just a painter he works on computer and machine he starts very early so if you've been on a long trip and you need  of your first morning of rest in order to start your stay in shape you can forget! you should also know that the cleaning leaves something to be desired, the room was full of dusted, I found the remains of chips on the floor, dust on the pillow (supporting evidence I took photos)Note also that dog come inside \\u00ab\\u00a0the private room partition\\u00a0\\u00bb when you open it.Know that this is the first negative opinion that I leave since I am registered on Airbnb (almost 9years) I have traveled all over the world and it is one of my 1st bad experience in a country so far from mine. I'm really amazed to see so many good feedbacks on Daniel I spent three really unpleasant days, I asked for a refund for the last 4 days that I will not spend in his apartment, which is totally legit, I could have ask for the full refund given the aggressive manner and the threatening tone of this one.  Know that I found in the heart of Manhattan a 4star hotel with all the comfort and cleanliness desired with the subway and restaurants right in front of this one, all for about the same price as \\\"his freezing loft\\\"  where it saves water heating and cleaning\\u2026 Don't get me wrong to think it's good value for money, in short I didn't come on holiday for that kind of thing.  I do not recommend Daniel's loft either for couples or for single travelers but rather for workers or students. Daniel will only be nice to you if you don't\",\n          \"First, I would like to be clear that this is a very honest review. I am a people-pleaser, an optimist, and I truly get along with anyone. It really is hard for me to say a negative word about anything, so this is coming from a place of genuine concern. I felt so bad bringing up the issues I had with this place to Chris and Zach that I was entirely silent about them because they really were kind hosts. However, I think it is very important for prospective guests to know what they are getting into because there are some components of the advertisement that are very misrepresentative of the actual experience here. LOCATION (MOST IMPORTANT!): To be quite honest: the location was the worst, most misleading component of this Airbnb and is something I am still very frustrated with to date. I have lived in inner cities in Philadelphia, Providence, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C. I am very comfortable with city living and know what precautions to take so that I am safe. I never walk anywhere while I'm on my phone and am always aware of my surroundings. However, I have never felt so threatened by a living situation before. I am a single, 20-year-old woman who was in town for a month for an internship, and I was CONSISTENTLY harassed while living in this neighborhood. The number of times I was cat-called, whistled at, and approached by men while on my way to work was innumerable. This has happened to me before in cities and, yes, it is an unfortunate part of life for most women, BUT the way Chris and Zach advertised the neighborhood made it seem like a family-friendly, college town or suburb, which is not at ALL the experience I had. I was followed home on one occasion that became so intimidating, I had to begin taking the subway to a station about 10 minutes away (Prospect Park) and Ubering every evening back to the Airbnb from work. This accumulated to upwards of $300. Let me be clear, again: I was never putting myself in a dangerous situation and (not that I have to justify what I was wearing) I was ALWAYS in professional dress because I was coming to/from work at a courthouse. Some of these intimidating occasions were as early as 7 AM and it was never later than 6 PM when I was walking home and it did not MATTER that there was a police station nearby. It is also only a three-block walk to the Church AV station closest to their home, something I should have easily been able to complete without fearing that I was in severe danger. Additionally, the neighborhood was LOUD. There were MANY occasions when I was woken up by people rattling through the trash right outside my bedroom window. Also, there was a man who would be up as early as 4:30 AM screaming at the top of his lungs. This didn't happen merely once, but at least five times and would continue for hours in the early morning. It was toward the end of my stay when I realized it wasn't someone roaming through the neighborhood, but a close neighbor. The location was a terribly devastating part of my stay and absolutely ruined my month-long experience in New York City. The description of where they live, in my opinion, is totally inaccurate and it is VITAL that young women, in particular, know that. If I had known what I was getting into, to be honest, there is no way I would have stayed at their place. In fact, I tried contacting Airbnb so I could leave about a week into my stay after I started getting harassed on my way to work, but the customer service was not helpful whatsoever and I was unable to secure a different place. A week into my stay, I actually paid for a hotel for several nights because I was having severe anxiety attacks (for the first time) about returning to the neighborhood, where I felt unsafe. Some examples from the description that should be updated as I found they are not very accurate: - \\\"typically quieter than most urban cities\\\" (false) - \\\"the neighbors are friendly,\\\" \\\"people with hearts of gold\\\" - \\\"young children\\\" (of which I saw absolutely none) - \\\"many students, young professionals, elderly, children live around\\\" - \\\"you're sure to get a friendly \\\"good morning!\\\" or \\\"God be with you!\\\" --> (in reality, I got \\\"good morning, sexy,\\\" \\\"give me your Snapchat, baby\\\" (and then was followed), among many other lewd comments) CLEANLINESS: Overall, the house was clean, but when there were problems, they were quite jarring. About halfway through my stay, I discovered that there had been mice in my bedroom, leading to another anxiety attack and night at a hotel in Manhattan. I found droppings and a bag of old food that I had left in the room on accident completely chewed through. While I should have been smarter than to leave food in my room, apparently mice weren't a new problem for Chris and Zach. Chris informed me that when they renovated the house several years ago, they had found mice nests and needed to call an exterminator. This time, she set up traps and was able to trap a mouse in the kitchen. Chris was very helpful in resolving the situation -- this was a plus, as she was responsive to any problems that I encountered and she did refund me for the night I discovered the mouse. Additionally, there were several occasions when I saw water bugs in the shower. This can be a part of city living but it was unfortunate, especially for someone who doesn't like the thought of critters. VALUE: I paid over $2,000 to rent this place for a month while I had my internship and it did not live up to my expectations in the slightest. I truly was so frazzled by the location...\",\n          \"Looking forward to the New Year holiday, my friend and I flew all the way from Los Angeles, California, to New York, considering Airbnb as a good option to stay at, in which we trusted through previous experiences. However, the stay at Nadia and Myles' place in South Harlem reputed in a terrible case of PTSD, financial damage, and may still result in future medical bills due to exposure to biohazards conditions, and hantavirus. The fallacious behavior of the owner, who very reluctantly, after a few long emails, and images forwarded, admitted the obvious rat and rodent infestation; and refused any type of refund or remedy, due to his personal thoughts, regardless of evidence found in the unit, in which there were previous roach and rat traps.First of all, the unit was highly infested by the rats, and roaches. Upon arrival, cockroach feces on \\\"clean plates\\\" left in the kitchen drying slats, on silverware, on the walls, and rat feces smeared into the floor, and left in various places in the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom; along with evidence to show this infestation has previously caused a hazardous condition; resulting in the unit being uninhabitable, due to biohazards conditions. A large rat, within a matter of hours, at large holes in belongings, (including leather), with clear financial damage far exceeding any perceived advantage of staying in a BNB, versus a four star hotel. (Owner cited in response text he knew \\\"it was difficult to find a hotel during the New Year\\\", alluding to the fact the owner raised the rates of the unit, in a predatory fashion, before the New Year, in response to this. (Quite the contrary, my flatmate and I found a wonderful four star hotel, last minute, in Manhattan, for the exact same price). In our room, there was a partially eaten cookie on the bed, o n a plate, which demonstrates the owner's lack of due diligence, and inaction of infestations- using BNB as an alternative to renting or selling the uninhabitable unit, and circumventing city inspections; placing occupants in danger in a knowledgable way, for unjust enrichments. There is an obvious hole, at the left base of the floor, under radiator in the bedroom, with rat chew holes in the floor, which has caused heating/gas problems and leakage in the radiator; to which the rats travel freely from the basement, and sewers, into the guest's rooms, and onto the bed, and the desk, near the footing of the bed, and under the bed; where the rats received previous treats on a plate, under the guest bed leaving biohazards conditions including but not limited to: gas leaks, hantavirus, and a multitude of diseases, not to mention the multiple bites resulting  from an infestation in the bedspreads, of the fleas on the rats. The owner very reluctantly admitted he had found a rat, after we sent images, showing proof; and claimed to be shocked, even though there were many obvious places contains rat feces, evidenced and displayed by images.Attempting to communicate with Myles, he, very reluctantly, after many texts, termed this infestation, \\\"a problem we have tried to manage\\\", which clearly displays his awareness of the hazardous conditions, and uninhabitable condition of the apartment. Moreover, a large older Combat trap was found under the sink, as evidence of this awareness, yet lack of due diligence in performance.In addition to the factors discussed above, many other factors must be considered. There is an old bullet directly above the sleeping position above the bed, that appears to be from a previous suicide, with a lighter pink paint showing around the bullet hole. There is an inordinate amount of pubic hair everywhere in the bathroom, on everything from the sink to the toilet, and the shower curtains, to the walls. The \\\"fresh\\\" towels left by the owner in the bathroom hanging on the towel rack on the door, have such a strong odor of mildew, the smell has permeated the wall of the door, and nothing can be hung anywhere near the door, or will result in the same strong odor. Additionally, there are avoided inspector notifications on the door from October, (we stayed in the very end of Dec, display owner avoidance of city regulator/government inspections regarding and notifying gas heating, etc. If all of these conditions weren't hazardous enough, the unit reeks of ammonia as if someone has been smoking illegal drugs in the unit, that have permeated the halls and bedroom walls. The advertisement for this B&B promises guests various walking distances to train stations, (which were closed at this time). It is important to note, that the street, during this 48 hour time frame, were closed, due to law enforcement officials having to close the street, with an ambulance and a coroner. Uber and Lyft refuse to drop anyone off in front of this address, resulting from having to walk, in the middle of the night, through the adjacent Harlem projects. In essence, the unit is unsuitable for any type of human habitation. The owner having no alternative but to circumvent local NY laws and inspections, and with a lack of any interest for local renters or buyers, due to obvious hazardous conditions, has attempted unjust enrichment, by using this B&B service to rent an otherwise uninhabitable unit, by city, state, and government standards and inspections. Our 48 hour stay, (after a matter of hours, we could not leave, as it was at night, and again, had no way to leave the unit safely), unfortunately show a dark side of B& behavior of an owner of a unit with shockingly.In addition to the factors discussed above, many other factors must be considered.

Small problems when we arrived there was no one to receive us, and the soap for the shower, the dishwashing liquid were missing, we received them the day after tomorrow. There is also the noise of the NY Metro, so a difficult first night if you are not used to it. Jennifer is correct the refund of the deposit was very fast. Apart from these small details our short stay went well. If I have the opportunity to return to NY for the holidays, I will stay at \"The Midtown Castle\" Jean Possession - Reunion Island   \n",

A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.\\rAttention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!   \n",

There is also the noise of the NY Metro, so a difficult first night if you are not used to it. Jennifer is correct the refund of the deposit was very fast.

We enjoyed the apartment which is very well located. Pleasant, clean and well maintained. It is ideal for a family of 3 or 4 people. Small problems when we arrived there was no one to receive us, and the soap for the shower, the dishwashing liquid were missing, we received them the day after tomorrow. There is also the noise of the NY Metro, so a difficult first night if you are not used to it. Jennifer is correct the refund of the deposit was very fast. Apart from these small details our short stay went well. If I have the opportunity to return to NY for the holidays, I will stay at \"The Midtown Castle\" Jean Possession - Reunion Island   \n",

Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.\\rAttention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!   \n",

              "7   This apartment is like a real castle old and unique. The age- related stains on the bathroom floor and dark discolorations in the carpet too indeed indicate that the building was built a long, long time ago. \\rWe weren’t happy with the way the apartment was cleaned. Jennifer, the host sent in a cleaning lady right the next morning and therefore did everything she thought was appropriate to make our stay comfortable. She let us know that guest satisfaction is important to her.   \\rAfter we found out that the key for the main entrance was missing by locking ourselves out in the middle of the night she was so kind to bring us the missing key within an hour. \\rWe had to leave the apartment a few days earlier because we suffered from an allergic reaction (which has never happened before and never after) related to the air conditioner as our doctor told us. \\rThe apartment is located in a great area! Subway stations are just two minutes away! The area seems quite safe although there are “special” adult video stores located in the same street nearby.  \\rA deli/grocery store is next to the building, a 24 hours open pharmacy is across the end of the street! \\r   \n",

She supplied books and notes with all sorts of information about NY, the flat and the area. The flat is in the perfect location, not more than a 10 minute walk from Times Square and about the same distance from Penn station. The apartment itself is just as described, great for one or two people. I highly recommend the apartment and will surely use it again next time I'm in NY!   \n",

Great communication and made sure I was all set for my big weekend with my college age daughter.\\r\\rI love all parts of NYC, but if you want Midtown, this is just about perfect. The place is sunny and bright and surpisingly little noise from the street on Friday and Saturday night. Plus, we felt very safe.\\r\\rSize wise, 1-2 people is probably perfect. Any more may feel a little cramped.\\r\\rLastly, most Airnb places I stay feel liked they have been furnished by a recent college grad. It's clear that Jennifer lives here and was so accomodating opening up her home to us.   \n",

This place was not clean, nor did it look like much had been done in prep for our arrival. Very superficially dusted. The shelves for glasses were gritty, the glass surface for the hot plate was grimy, utensils were dirty, random blankets for bedding were strewn on a metal shelf in the livingrm that was also pinching a mattress btw the floor & a closet, light switch was very dirty, pillows on chairs and sofa looked like someone had just gotten up from napping, a full seam on the sofa pillow was torn & held closed by a safety pin. My son came to visit & brought his little dog, which I didn't realize was not welcome. Sorry that happened. The dog didn't return after we realized \"no dogs allowed.\"  And, I would've appreciated being notified that Jane was planning to come downstairs while we were out. The screen had been moved which felt a little creepy. Plusses: The place is large and great location.   \n",

There, bad surprise: the accommodation, which we had understood to be a ground floor, was in fact a cellar in a courtyard full of garbage, trash cans, and used furniture. The \"apartment\" had no windows, no ventilation, was really of questionable cleanliness, the fridge did not work... The first evening while cooking, we had the unpleasant surprise of meeting a cockroach, then two, then three... Same in the courtyard where they were swarming. The second evening, we realized that there were fleas in the bedding, so we left. Even though we had paid for five nights. We never met Edward, who still sent us an email to see if there was a problem... I forget: the encounters with the local bums who wash themselves with a hose in the yard or who rummage through the trash when you go out in the morning. Even if it is eminently well located in NY (although the East Village takes on the appearance of a courtyard of miracles during the day, with gatherings of misfits), inexpensive, and not far from transport and a convenience store, an address to absolutely avoid, unless you are a very very very hardened backpacker.   \n",

The room was equipped with dishes, bath towels, hair dryer, toothbrush and shower gel. The nearest subway station is unfortunately not as close as expected. There are many places to eat in the area. Check-in and check-out were not very professional. In both cases, she was not easy to reach by phone. Communication with the host was therefore difficult.   \n",

The place is located on the ground floor and created from a cellar , without windows and you have to cross mountains of trash to reach to the main door . Inside the place is completely old , messed up and dirty . Our room itself was very small  and dark , the mattress full of bumps and couvert with old dark bedsheets . On the sealing there are many pipes running and making noise all  night long  , the same for the old fridge . The shared bad room , without window , was very small , old and incredible dirty !!!!!! The place was also full of flies , probably because of the trash in front of the door where you can see also ratts at night .   \n",

The room is average but there are no closets to store clothes. Shared bathroom, very small. You can hardly brush your teeth because of the small sink. The bathroom could be cleaner. The worst part of the stay was hearing rats running and squeaking on the walls every day. You could hear it often and it was quite disgusting. Also, the patio through which you enter the apartment was full of trash and lots of rats. We mentioned this to Edward but he said he couldn't do anything because it was common in New York. I wouldn't stay here again because of the rats.   \n",

              "5230  We chose this apartment because we would be in the city during the day anyway. As long as we had a bed and a place where we could quickly eat breakfast. Unfortunately, we underestimated this. Despite the cleaning costs we paid, there were clumps of dust on the floor, all the dishes were still dirty, the bathroom floor was covered in hair and dust and the towels smelled strongly of urine. It seemed as if all the extractor hoods of the apartment building came out into this room, we both felt (without exaggeration) extremely nauseous from all the different food smells that hung in the room. Unfortunately, because it is winter, it was too cold to open the windows. The heating made such an intensely loud noise that we preferred to have it off as well. The bed is extremely worn and has a dip in the middle, so you keep rolling towards each other. The dark bedding also hides dirty spots, which made us sleep uncomfortably. The shower head is fixed with duck tape and also leaks. The landlords have a top rating, but when we arrived we were barely given 5 minutes to be welcomed. Also good to know: the nearest metro is a 20-minute walk away. A plus: although we didn't use it, there is a metro map and a mobile phone with internet in the room that you can use.   \n",

Very superficially dusted. The shelves for glasses were gritty, the glass surface for the hot plate was grimy, utensils were dirty, random blankets for bedding were strewn on a metal shelf in the livingrm that was also pinching a mattress btw the floor &amp; a closet, light switch was very dirty, pillows on chairs and sofa looked like someone had just gotten up from napping, a full seam on the sofa pillow was torn &amp; held closed by a safety pin. My son came to visit &amp; brought his little dog, which I didn't realize was not welcome. Sorry that happened. The dog didn't return after we realized \"no dogs allowed.\"  And, I would've appreciated being notified that Jane was planning to come downstairs while we were out.

The first evening while cooking, we had the unpleasant surprise of meeting a cockroach, then two, then three... Same in the courtyard where they were swarming. The second evening, we realized that there were fleas in the bedding, so we left. Even though we had paid for five nights.

I forget: the encounters with the local bums who wash themselves with a hose in the yard or who rummage through the trash when you go out in the morning.

It seemed as if all the extractor hoods of the apartment building came out into this room, we both felt (without exaggeration) extremely nauseous from all the different food smells that hung in the room. Unfortunately, because it is winter, it was too cold to open the windows. The heating made such an intensely loud noise that we preferred to have it off as well. The bed is extremely worn and has a dip in the middle, so you keep rolling towards each other. The dark bedding also hides dirty spots, which made us sleep uncomfortably. The shower head is fixed with duck tape and also leaks. The landlords have a top rating, but when we arrived we were barely given 5 minutes to be welcomed.

As long as we had a bed and a place where we could quickly eat breakfast. Unfortunately, we underestimated this. Despite the cleaning costs we paid, there were clumps of dust on the floor, all the dishes were still dirty, the bathroom floor was covered in hair and dust and the towels smelled strongly of urine. It seemed as if all the extractor hoods of the apartment building came out into this room, we both felt (without exaggeration) extremely nauseous from all the different food smells that hung in the room. Unfortunately, because it is winter, it was too cold to open the windows. The heating made such an intensely loud noise that we preferred to have it off as well. The bed is extremely worn and has a dip in the middle, so you keep rolling towards each other. The dark bedding also hides dirty spots, which made us sleep uncomfortably. The shower head is fixed with duck tape and also leaks. The landlords have a top rating, but when we arrived we were barely given 5 minutes to be welcomed. Also good to know: the nearest metro is a 20-minute walk away. A plus: although we didn't use it, there is a metro map and a mobile phone with internet in the room that you can use.\",\n          \"Comfortable bed. The room is average but there are no closets to store clothes. Shared bathroom, very small. You can hardly brush your teeth because of the small sink. The bathroom could be cleaner. The worst part of the stay was hearing rats running and squeaking on the walls every day. You could hear it often and it was quite disgusting. Also, the patio through which you enter the apartment was full of trash and lots of rats. We mentioned this to Edward but he said he couldn't do anything because it was common in New York. I wouldn't stay here again because of the rats.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 71,\n        \"min\": 3,\n        \"max\": 225,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 19,\n        \"samples\": [\n          24,\n          178,\n          5\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"has_html\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          false\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lang\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"en\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"polarity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.20517355535985035,\n        \"min\": -1.0,\n        \"max\": -0.059999999999999984,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -0.0625\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subjectivity\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.22853381814166887,\n        \"min\": 0.1875,\n        \"max\": 1.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 17,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.1875\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Small problems when we arrived there was no one to receive us, and the soap for the shower, the dishwashing liquid were missing, we received them the day after tomorrow.

A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.\\rAttention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!   \n",

              "0       Our three-night stay. We enjoyed the apartment which is very well located. Pleasant, clean and well maintained. It is ideal for a family of 3 or 4 people. Small problems when we arrived there was no one to receive us, and the soap for the shower, the dishwashing liquid were missing, we received them the day after tomorrow. There is also the noise of the NY Metro, so a difficult first night if you are not used to it. Jennifer is correct the refund of the deposit was very fast. Apart from these small details our short stay went well. If I have the opportunity to return to NY for the holidays, I will stay at \"The Midtown Castle\" Jean Possession - Reunion Island   \n",

A big spacious room with a pointy roof, which really makes you feel like staying in a castle. The location is perfect. It is just a few steps from Macy's Time Square and Theatre District. Everything worked just perfect with the keys etc. Thank you so much Jennifer, we had a great time in New York.\\rAttention: it's on the 4th floor without a lift :-) but definetely worth it!   \n",

Midtown castle is a beauftiful and tastful place, Jennifer and Tori relaxed and friendly hosts - thats why we - the three Berliners - recommand that place! Good to have WiFi and a little kitchen too!   \n",

There is also the noise of the NY Metro, so a difficult first night if you are not used to it. Jennifer is correct the refund of the deposit was very fast.
